We will only focus on the basic programming aspects essential for analyzing data and extracting meaningful information rather than deep dive into the nitty-gritty of python programming language or machine learning algorithms.

Data Science: It is an interdisciplinary field that combines computer science, statistics, and mathematics to extract, analyze and generate useful insights from data for better business decisions.

Data science analyzes raw data using simple statistical techniques or more complicated and sophisticated machine learning techniques to draw insights from the data. Nonetheless, the key focus of data science is actually deriving insights using whatever techniques that give better results. It is used in many industries to make better business decisions and test models or theories in the sciences.
